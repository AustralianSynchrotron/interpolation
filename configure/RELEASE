# Run "gnumake clean uninstall install" in the application
# top directory each time this file is changed.
#
# NOTE: The build does not check dependancies on files
# external to this application. Thus you should run
# "gnumake clean uninstall install" in the top directory
# each time EPICS_BASE, SNCSEQ, or any other external
# module defined in the RELEASE file is rebuilt.

TEMPLATE_TOP=$(EPICS_BASE)/templates/makeBaseApp/top

# If you don't want to install into $(TOP) then
# define INSTALL_LOCATION_APP here
#INSTALL_LOCATION_APP=<fullpathname>

# Leave blank withinn source code repository.

BUNDLE=

#If using the sequencer, point SNCSEQ at its top directory:
#SNCSEQ=$(BUNDLE)/epics/seq

# EPICS_BASE usually appears last so other apps can override stuff:
#
EPICS_BASE=$(BUNDLE)/epics/base

# end
